# Interview Scheduler

Scheduler is a single-page React application that allows a user to book, cancel and track interviews for their weekly schedule. Appointments can be reserved in the application between the hours of 12 PM - 5 PM, Monday to Friday.

The user has the ability to execute the following actions:

- Create and save a new interview, with a student name and selected interviewer
- Edit existing interviews, updating the students name and interviewer
- Delete interviews from the schedule
- View the schedule for each day of the week

The application implements React based components and hooks to create a smooth user experience while the user is interacting with the application. The front end of this application makes requests using AXIOS to a pre-built API to fetch and store appointment data. All components and featured data update in real time based on browser events.
